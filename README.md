# Artifact Download Action with File Permission Preservation

This composite action, based on [`actions/download-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact) and
extracting the artifact's content from a tarball, will preserve file attributes like **file permissions**. This
essential capability is not implemented by GitHub until now (requested on [05.12.2019](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/38))
and still delayed and/or refused? to be implemented in the future. According to GitHub, the internal API doesn't allow
the implementation of such a feature, but this actions is demonstrating a working solution.

ðŸ“¤ See [pyTooling/upload-artifact](https://github.com/pyTooling/upload-artifact) for the matching upload action.

## Fixed behavior compared to `actions/download-artifact`

1. **Preserve file permissions**  
   The artifact's content is collected in a tarball, which allows preserving file attributes like file permissions.
2. **Don't remove common prefix from files**  
   `actions/upload-artifact` removes the common prefix from all files before storing in an artifact. This is not a
   well-defined behavior. Slightly changing the list of collected files might drastically change the directory structure
   of the artifact.  
   This action defines a root directory from where the content of the tarball is constructed. This is independent of the
   list of provided file patterns.

## Further Features

* Accepts artifacts uploaded from `actions/upload-artifact` (legacy artifacts) and `pyTooling/upload-artifacts`.
